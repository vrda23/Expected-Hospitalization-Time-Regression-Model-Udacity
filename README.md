# Expected-Hospitalization-Time-Regression-Model-Udacity
- Expected Hospitalization Time Regression Model: built off of the UCI Diabetes readmission dataset
- Predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial.
- Implements Aequitas for model bias analysis across demographic groups
